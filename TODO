- sentence tokenizer:
  - flex is fast, now works almost as good as perl
    - small thing to change: after end-of-sentence punct and an "\n" we supposed
      a real-end-of-sentence, but it should be checked whether next character is
      sentence starter
  - flex needs (perl would also!) abbreviations, non-breaking prefixes

- boilerplate code detection
  we have an implementation right now in py, works ok, but eats up a lot of memory
- finnish (or any non-hunspell language) language detection should be done
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
