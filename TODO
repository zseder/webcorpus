- sentence tokenizer:
  - small thing to change: after end-of-sentence punct and an "\n" we supposed
      a real-end-of-sentence, but it should be checked whether next character is
      sentence starter
  - create non-breaking prefixes to languages by statistics based on words that end 
    with "."

- finnish (or any non-hunspell language) language detection should be done
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
