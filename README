This project is a collection of scripts and programs for creating webcorpus
from crawled data.
The input is extracted data from wire crawler (http://www.cwr.cl/projects/WIRE/)
and the output is a text file with document separators and raw text

Dependencies:
- gcc
- flex
- libtextcat
  - http://software.wise-guys.nl/libtextcat/
  - WARNING: libtextcat unfortunately uses confidence parameter as predefined,
    and it cannot be changed in runtime, we created a little patch that does the
    work so before compiling and installing libtextcat, please apply our patch
    at src/libtextcat-2.2.patch with
    - patch -p1 < /path/to/libtextcat-2.2.patch # while being in a directory
      that contains original libtextcat-2.2; or
    - patch -p2 < /path/to/libtextcat-2.2.patch # while being in the actual
      libtextcat-2.2 directory
- libhunspell
  - we only used libhunspell-1.3 for testing
