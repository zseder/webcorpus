This project is a collection of scripts and programs for creating webcorpus
from crawled data.
The input is extracted data from wire crawler (http://www.cwr.cl/projects/WIRE/)
and the output is a text file with document separators and raw text

Dependencies:
- gcc
- flex
- libtextcat
  - WARNING: libtextcat unfortunately uses confidence parameter as predefined,
    and it cannot be changed in runtime, so its constants.h has to be modified
    langclass/conf.txt should be also changed to fing language models
