- boilerplate code detection
  we have an implementation right now in py, works ok, but eats up a lot of memory
- finnish (or any non-hunspell language) language detection should be done
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
