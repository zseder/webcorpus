- sentence tokenizer:
  - small thing to change: after end-of-sentence punct and an "\n" we supposed
      a real-end-of-sentence, but it should be checked whether next character is
      sentence starter
  - create non-breaking prefixes to languages by statistics based on words that end 
    with "."
- clean_encoding: when cleaning utf-8 chars, one-utf8 character should be suspicious,
  because if different 1byte encoding was supposed in wire that it was really, encoding
  also went wrong

- finnish (or any non-hunspell language) language detection should be done
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
