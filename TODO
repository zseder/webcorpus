- lots of codes/scripts to add
- 2 Makefiles:
  - compiler
  - runner
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
- flex should drop all sites that has unfinished tags
  - maybe later docfilter will do it, but DOCSTART/DOCEND can be messed up before
- splitcode related question
  - splitcode.h as right now
  - sed-ing a unique string to a splitcode in every script and source code
    in Makefile before actual compiling?
