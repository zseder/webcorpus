- boilerplate code detection
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
- smart detection of wrong characters: "u with circumflex" replaced by double accent
  - no need, but clean_wire_encoding should be implemented in a way to
    detect wrong encodings if the error is with sites, who were handled
    as non-utf-8 (LATINx, windows-125x, etc.) even though they were, and so
    with two iconv this can be fixed!
- sentence-split.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- html_entity_replace.py could be implemented in flex or cc also to be faster
  HTMLParser.unescape() implementation helps a lot (2.6+)
