- near duplicate detection
- boilerplate code detection
- dependency checker script (instead of configure)
- smart detection of wrong characters: "u with circumflex" replaced by double accent
- sentence-split.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- tokenizer.perl should be reimplemented in flex (check out huntoken)
- html_entity_replace.py could be implemented in flex or cc also to be faster
  HTMLParser.unescape() implementation helps a lot (2.6+)
